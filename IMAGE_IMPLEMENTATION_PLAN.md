# Image Implementation Plan for Crescent Beach Hotel Website

## Current Situation
- The website currently uses placeholder images in `/public/images/`
- No actual hotel images have been downloaded or implemented
- Images from Booking.com would need proper licensing/permission

## Options for Getting Real Images

### Option 1: Official Hotel Images (Recommended)
1. Contact the hotel directly for official promotional images
2. Request high-resolution photos with usage rights
3. Get images for:
   - Hotel exterior and facade
   - Beach and beachfront
   - All room types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
   - Restaurants (Terrace, Wild West Bar, Shade Bar, Pool Bar)
   - Swimming pools (indoor and outdoor)
   - Spa and wellness facilities
   - Conference rooms
   - Lobby and common areas

### Option 2: Booking.com Images (Requires Permission)
- Images on Booking.com are typically owned by the hotel or Booking.com
- Would need to verify image rights and get permission
- Could potentially use Booking.com's Partner Hub if hotel has access

### Option 3: Stock Photos (Temporary)
- Use high-quality stock photos that match the hotel's description
- Label them clearly as representative images
- Replace with actual photos when available

## Image Requirements

### Homepage Hero
- High-resolution beach/hotel exterior shot
- Minimum 1920x1080px
- Optimized for web (compressed)

### Room Images

- Main room view
- Bathroom

- Room amenities
- Minimum 800x600px each

### Dining Images
For each restaurant/bar:
- Interior ambiance
- Food presentations
- Bar/seating areas
- Minimum 800x600px

### Amenity Images

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Image Directory Structure**:
```
/public/images/
  /hotel/
    - exterior.jpg
    - lobby.jpg
    - beach-view.jpg
  /rooms/
    /standard/
    /deluxe/
    /suite/
  /dining/
    /terrace/
    /wild-west/
    /shade-bar/
    /pool-bar/
  /amenities/
    /beach/
    /pools/
    /spa/
    /fitness/
  /gallery/
```

2. **Image Optimization**:
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Implement lazy loading
- Create multiple sizes for responsive design
- Use WebP format where supported

3. **Placeholder Strategy**:
- Use blur placeholders while images load
- Implement skeleton screens for galleries

## Legal Considerations
- Ensure proper licensing for all images
- Include photographer credits where required
- Maintain documentation of image rights

## Next Steps
1. Contact hotel for official images
2. Set up image optimization pipeline
3. Implement lazy loading galleries
4. Add image alt texts for accessibility
5. Configure CDN for faster delivery
